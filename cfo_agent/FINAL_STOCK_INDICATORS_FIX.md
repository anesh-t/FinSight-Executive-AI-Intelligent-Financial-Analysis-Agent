# FINAL STOCK INDICATORS FIX - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **100% SUCCESS - ALL 19 TESTS PASSING**

---

## üéØ ISSUES FIXED

### **Issue #1: Quarterly Opening Price (and other indicators)**
**Problem:** "Apple opening stock price Q2 2023" returned:
```
Data found for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in Q2 FY2023.
```

**Root Cause:** Formatter checked for `avg_open_price` but quarterly data has `open_price` (actual opening).

### **Issue #2: Combined Quarterly Queries Missing Stock Prices**
**Problem:** "Show Apple revenue and closing stock price Q2 2023" only showed revenue.

**Root Cause:** `complete_quarterly` template didn't include stock price columns.

---

## üîß FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### **FIX #1: Updated Formatter for Quarterly Opening Price**

**File:** `/cfo_agent/formatter.py` (Lines 557-578)

**Change:** Check for actual `open_price` (quarterly) before `avg_open_price_annual`:

```python
# Opening price
if ('opening_price' in requested_metrics):
    if wants_average:
        # User explicitly asked for average
        if 'avg_open_price_annual' in row and row['avg_open_price_annual'] is not None:
            parts.append(f"average opening price of ${float(row['avg_open_price_annual']):.2f}")
        elif 'avg_open_price' in row and row['avg_open_price'] is not None:
            parts.append(f"average opening price of ${float(row['avg_open_price']):.2f}")
    else:
        # User asked for just "opening price" - check quarterly then annual
        # Quarterly: open_price (start of quarter)
        if 'open_price' in row and row['open_price'] is not None:
            parts.append(f"opening price of ${float(row['open_price']):.2f}")
        # Annual: Use average (no "first day of year" opening price exists)
        elif 'avg_open_price_annual' in row and row['avg_open_price_annual'] is not None:
            parts.append(f"opening price of ${float(row['avg_open_price_annual']):.2f}")
        # Fallback to averages
        elif 'avg_open_price' in row and row['avg_open_price'] is not None:
            parts.append(f"opening price of ${float(row['avg_open_price']):.2f}")
```

**Result:** Now correctly shows quarterly opening price ($126.89)

---

### **FIX #2: Added Stock Columns to Complete Quarterly Template**

**File:** `/cfo_agent/catalog/templates.json` (Line 159)

**Before:**
```sql
SELECT ticker, name, fiscal_year, fiscal_quarter, revenue/1e9 as revenue_b, 
       ..., avg_price, return_qoq, return_yoy, ...
```

**After:**
```sql
SELECT ticker, name, fiscal_year, fiscal_quarter, revenue/1e9 as revenue_b, 
       ..., avg_price, open_price, close_price, high_price, low_price, 
       return_qoq, return_yoy, ...
```

**Result:** Combined quarterly queries now show stock prices!
