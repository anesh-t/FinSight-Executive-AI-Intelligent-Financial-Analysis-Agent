## 🔧 **How It Works:**

### **1. Keyword Detection:**
The system analyzes your question to identify which metrics you're asking about:

```python
def _extract_requested_metrics(self, question: str) -> set:
    """Extract which metrics were specifically requested"""
    question_upper = question.upper()
    requested = set()
    
    # Revenue keywords
    if any(word in question_upper for word in ['REVENUE', 'SALES', 'TOP LINE']):
        requested.add('revenue')
    
    # Net income keywords
    if any(word in question_upper for word in ['NET INCOME', 'PROFIT', 'EARNINGS']):
        requested.add('net_income')
    
    # ... and so on for 30+ financial metrics
    
    return requested
```

### **2. Selective Display:**
Only requested metrics are shown in the response:

```python
# Revenue - only show if requested or generic query
if (show_all or 'revenue' in requested_metrics):
    if 'revenue_b' in row:
        parts.append(f"revenue of ${row['revenue_b']:.2f}B")

# Net income - only show if requested
if (show_all or 'net_income' in requested_metrics):
    if 'net_income_b' in row:
        parts.append(f"net income of ${row['net_income_b']:.2f}B")
```

### **3. Generic Queries:**
If no specific metrics are mentioned (or generic keywords like "metrics", "financial data"), show all available:

```python
# If no specific metrics found, check if it's a generic query
if not requested:
    generic_keywords = ['METRICS', 'DATA', 'INFORMATION', 'FINANCIAL', 'PERFORMANCE']
    if any(word in question_upper for word in generic_keywords):
        requested.add('all')  # Show everything
```
