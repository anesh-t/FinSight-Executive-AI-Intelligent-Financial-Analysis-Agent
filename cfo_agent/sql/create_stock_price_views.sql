-- STOCK PRICE VIEWS - QUARTERLY & ANNUAL
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose: Create clean views for stock price data to match the pattern used
--          for financial data (fact_financials â†’ mv_financials_annual)
-- 
-- Pattern:
--   - Quarterly: vw_stock_prices_quarter (passthrough from fact_stock_prices)
--   - Annual: mv_stock_prices_annual (aggregated materialized view)
