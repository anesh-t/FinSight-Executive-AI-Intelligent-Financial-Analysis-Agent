## üí° TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use company names (Apple, Microsoft, Google) or tickers (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG)
- Specify year (2023) or quarter (Q4 2023)
- Use "and" to combine metrics: "revenue and net income"
- Ask for "average" explicitly if you want yearly averages
- Compare up to 3-4 companies for clarity

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Mix quarterly and annual in same query
- Use overly complex sentences
- Forget to specify the year/period

## üéØ SPECIAL FEATURES

### 1. Smart Metric Detection
The system understands variations:
- "revenue" = "sales" = "total revenue"
- "net income" = "profit" = "earnings"
- "closing price" = "close price"
- "opening and closing" detects both metrics

### 2. Multi-Company Intelligence
- Automatically queries each company separately
- Combines results into clean comparison format
- Shows bullet points for easy reading

### 3. Average vs Actual Prices
- **Without "average"**: Returns actual end-of-year price
- **With "average"**: Returns yearly average price
- Significant for volatile stocks (MSFT: $376 vs $330)

### 4. Flexible Period Formats
All these work:
- "2023" = "FY2023" = "year 2023"
- "Q4 2023" = "fourth quarter 2023" = "4Q 2023"
