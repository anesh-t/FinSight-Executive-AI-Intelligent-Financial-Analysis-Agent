## üìä **Data Sources:**

### **Annual Queries** ‚Üí `mv_financials_annual` view
Contains pre-aggregated annual totals:
- `r_and_d_expenses_annual` (sum of 4 quarters)
- `sgna_annual` (SG&A annual total)
- `cogs_annual` (COGS annual total)

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT f.r_and_d_expenses_annual/1e9 as rd_annual_b,
       f.sgna_annual/1e9 as sga_annual_b,
       f.cogs_annual/1e9 as cogs_annual_b
FROM mv_financials_annual f
WHERE fiscal_year = 2023
```

### **Quarterly Queries** ‚Üí `fact_financials` table
Contains raw quarterly values:
- `r_and_d_expenses` (quarterly)
- `sg_and_a_expenses` (quarterly)
- `cogs` (quarterly)

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT f.r_and_d_expenses/1e9 as rd_b,
       f.sg_and_a_expenses/1e9 as sga_b,
       f.cogs/1e9 as cogs_b
FROM fact_financials f
WHERE fiscal_year = 2023 AND fiscal_quarter = 2
```

## üîß **Implementation Details:**

### **1. Updated Templates:**

#### **`annual_metrics` template:**
```json
{
  "intent": "annual_metrics",
  "description": "Annual metrics including revenue, income, expenses (R&D, SG&A, COGS), and ratios",
  "sql": "SELECT ..., f.r_and_d_expenses_annual/1e9 as rd_annual_b, 
                f.sgna_annual/1e9 as sga_annual_b, 
                f.cogs_annual/1e9 as cogs_annual_b ...",
  "surface": "mv_financials_annual"
}
```

#### **`quarter_snapshot` template:**
```json
{
  "intent": "quarter_snapshot",
  "description": "Quarterly metrics including revenue, income, expenses (R&D, SG&A, COGS)",
  "sql": "SELECT ..., f.r_and_d_expenses/1e9 as rd_b, 
                f.sg_and_a_expenses/1e9 as sga_b, 
                f.cogs/1e9 as cogs_b ...",
  "surface": "fact_financials"
}
```

### **2. Intent Detection Logic:**

Expense queries follow the same rules as revenue/income:

```python
# Year specified WITHOUT quarter ‚Üí annual_metrics
if has_year and not has_quarter:
    intent = "annual_metrics"  # Uses mv_financials_annual

# Quarter specified ‚Üí quarter_snapshot  
elif has_quarter:
    intent = "quarter_snapshot"  # Uses fact_financials
```

**Keywords detected:**
- R&D, R AND D, RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT
- SG&A, SGA, SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE
- COGS, COST OF GOODS, OPERATING EXPENSE, OPEX

### **3. Response Formatter:**

Enhanced to display expense data:

```python
# R&D Expenses (quarterly)
if 'rd_b' in row:
    parts.append(f"R&D expenses of ${row['rd_b']:.2f}B")

# R&D Expenses (annual)
if 'rd_annual_b' in row:
    parts.append(f"R&D expenses of ${row['rd_annual_b']:.2f}B")

# SG&A Expenses
if 'sga_b' in row or 'sga_annual_b' in row:
    parts.append(f"SG&A expenses of ${...}B")

# COGS
if 'cogs_b' in row or 'cogs_annual_b' in row:
    parts.append(f"COGS of ${...}B")
```
